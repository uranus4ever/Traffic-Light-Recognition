# Traffic-Light-Recognition
Detect traffic light and identify RED, YELLOW and GREEN lights and count-down numbers with deep learning.

##The traffic light recognition is based on Keras-Yolo3 with yolo v3 weights
###01/03/2019 note by Tang Nicholas:
###    Currently implemented output single object (traffic light)
###    The color detection is on going (where the info. of color will be shown on the corner of output img)
###    Plan to use cascade NN to implement above function.
